# Help & Commonly Asked Questions

## Opening MS-DOS Prompt seems to glitch up the screen
Hit `Alt + Enter` to make the command screen "Full Screen" (as far as Windows 95 is
concerned). This should restore the display from the garbled mess you see and allow
you to access the MS-DOS Prompt. Press Alt-Enter again to leave Full Screen and go
back to Windowed Mode. (Thanks to @DisplacedGamers for that wisdom)

## Windows 95 is stuck in a bad state

On the app's home screen, select "Settings" in the lower menu. Then, delete your
machine's state before starting it again - this time hopefully without issues.

## I want to install additional apps or games

If you are running macOS, or Linux, you can probably "mount" the
virtual hard drive used by `windows95` to add files. Hit the "Modify C: Drive"
button, which will take you to the disk image.

On macOS, double-click the disk image to open it.

On Windows, It will _think_ that it can open up the image, but will
fail to do so. Use a tool [like OSFMount][osfmount] to mount your
disk image.

On Linux, search the Internet for instructions on how to mount an `img` disk
image on your distribution. You'll likely be able to run `mount`
with the image as input.
